## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive Power BI solution tailored for various decision makers within a healthcare organization. Each dashboard is customized to display specific objectives, KPIs, and DAX formulas that support strategic decision-making across different departments.

## Project Structure
- **project.pbix**: The Power BI project file containing all dashboards.
- **README.md**: This file, providing detailed project information.

## Dashboards and Key Features

### 1. Hospital or Healthcare System Executives (CEO, COO, CFO)
**Objective:**  
Provide an overview of the financial health, resource allocation, and operational performance.

**KPIs:**
- **Total Revenue:** Revenue generated by all services.
- **Departmental Resource Allocation:** Resources allocated and used by each department.
- **Cost vs. Revenue Analysis:** Compare total costs to revenue.
- **Service Growth Trends:** Track service utilization trends over time.

**DAX Formulas:**
- **Total Revenue:**
  ```DAX
  TotalRevenue = SUM('visits'[Treatment_Cost])
- **Departmental Resource Allocation:**
  ResourceAllocation = CALCULATE(SUM('visits'[Resource_Allocated]), 'visits'[Department_ID])

- **Cost vs. Revenue:**
  RevenueToCost = DIVIDE(SUM('visits'[Treatment_Cost]), SUM('visits'[Total_Cost]))

- **Service Growth:**
  ServiceGrowth = CALCULATE(COUNT('visits'[Visit_ID]), DATESINPERIOD('visits'[Visit_Date], MAX('visits'[Visit_Date]), -12, MONTH))
